# Avanta Design URL Shortener: UI/UX and Functionality Improvement Plan

## 1. Project Overview

The Avanta Design URL Shortener is a robust, self-hosted application built on Nuxt 3 and Cloudflare Workers. It provides essential link shortening and management capabilities, including a custom domain, an admin dashboard, and analytics. The technical stack is modern and leverages serverless technologies effectively.

This plan outlines potential improvements to enhance the user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and overall functionality of the application.

## 2. UI/UX Improvements

### 2.1. Dashboard Enhancements

The admin dashboard is the primary interface for managing links. These improvements focus on increasing efficiency and providing better data insights.

- **Bulk Actions:**
  - Implement checkboxes next to each link to allow for bulk selection.
  - Add a dropdown menu or action bar for bulk actions like "Delete," "Add Tag," or "Set Expiration." This is a highly requested feature, as indicated by the existing `bulk-delete-plan.md`.

- **Advanced Filtering and Sorting:**
  - **Filtering:** Add a more comprehensive filtering system. Allow users to filter links by creation date, last clicked date and tags
  - **Sorting:** Enable sorting of the links list by various criteria, such as "Most Clicks," "Fewest Clicks," "Creation Date," and "Last Modified."

- **Enhanced Data Visualization:**
  - The app already includes charting libraries. Leverage them further by creating more interactive and insightful visualizations in the analytics section.

### 2.2. Link Creation/Editing Flow

Streamlining the process of creating and editing links can significantly improve the user experience.

- **QR Code Generation:**
  - FIX QR CODE COLOR GENERATIONN SO IT DOESNT CHANGE TYPE OF QR CODE WHEN CHANGING COLOR

- **Link Preview:**
  - As a user types in the destination URL and custom slug, show a real-time preview of the final short URL.

- **Social Media Previews (Open Graph):**
  - Add fields in the link creation/editing form to specify custom `og:title`, `og:description`, and `og:image` tags. This would allow for branded social media previews when the short link is shared. if the user doesnt choose to change seo image, title or meta it should remain as original link. YOU WILL HAVE TO ADD IMAGE STORAGE, but limit it to the free size so we dont get into charges accidentally.

### 2.3. General UI Polish

These suggestions focus on refining the overall look and feel of the application.

- **Improved Notifications:**
  - Use the existing `vue-sonner` library to provide clear and immediate feedback for all user actions (e.g., "Link created successfully," "URL copied to clipboard," "Error saving link").

- **Empty States:**
  - Design visually appealing "empty state" components for pages where there is no data to display (e.g., no links created yet, no analytics data for a new link).

- **Responsiveness:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of the dashboard on various screen sizes, especially mobile, to ensure all components are accessible and easy to use.

## 3. Functionality Improvements

### 3.1. Advanced Link Features

Adding these features would make the URL shortener a more powerful marketing and tracking tool.

- **Link Expiration:**
  - Add an option to set an expiration date for a link.
  - Allow links to expire after a certain number of clicks.

- **Password Protection:**
  - Implement a feature to require a password before a user is redirected to the destination URL.

- **UTM Builder:**
  - Integrate a UTM parameter builder in the link creation form. This would help in creating consistent tracking tags for marketing campaigns.
