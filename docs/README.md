## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Is this backward compatible?
**A**: Yes! Existing links work without modification. New fields have default values.

### Q: What about performance with large datasets?
**A**: Optimized for performance! Batched API calls, efficient filtering, and virtualized lists ensure smooth UX even with thousands of links.

### Q: Can I extend this feature?
**A**: Absolutely! See the "Future Enhancements" section in [IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) for ideas.

### Q: How do I test this locally?
**A**: See the "Testing" section in [ADVANCED_FILTERING_SORTING.md](./ADVANCED_FILTERING_SORTING.md) for manual and automated testing instructions.
